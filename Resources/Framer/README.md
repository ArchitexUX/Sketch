###About

This is an iOS UI template that can be used with [FramerJS](http://www.framerjs.com), with Javascript code supplied for:

* Layer hierarchy and positioning
* Animating between the first and second screens, including a back button (vertical slide animation)
* iOS alerts (created entirely in code, supports title and message)
* Time that updates in the statusbar

..and other small bits of useful code.

Use this template with the [Sketch Framer plugin](https://github.com/bomberstudios/sketch-framer) (export your mockups to FramerJS).
