###About

JavaScript code (app.js) and an iOS UI template (AppTemplate.sketch) that can be used with [FramerJS](http://www.framerjs.com), and the [Sketch Framer plugin](https://github.com/bomberstudios/sketch-framer) for export.

The code contains some useful code and utility functions that can be used with any Sketch (or even Photoshop) file.

* Basic/good layer hierarchy and positioning
* Animating between the first and second screens, including a back button (vertical slide animation)
* iOS alerts (created entirely in code, supports title and message)
* Time that updates in the statusbar
* And more..
